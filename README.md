## Uncode.js
Welcome to the github repo for [Uncode.js](http://uncodejs.herokuapp.com/)!

Uncode translates JavaScript into human readable languages in real time, just as you are typing it. In this way, the platform  gives you a unique insight into how code is structured and how it works by allowing the you to experiment and see the result.

Uncode also allows code snippets to be uploaded in click of a button (or by dragging and dropping .js files into the editor), displaying the translation immediately - no waiting or loading. Users can log in via facebook, write and save snippets to their profile to access them again on demand. The whole app supports multiple languages: currently english, spanish and italian.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

In order to test this web-app you will need to run the compatible backend, visit [dc2.0-server](https://github.com/vidocco/dc2.0-server) and follow the initialization steps on that repo too.


### Installing

- Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/vidocco/dc2.0-client`
- Move into the new folder `cd dc2.0-client`
- Install all dependencies`npm install`
- To start the front-end run `npm start`. This activates the react start script and will display the front-end, you will need to have the back-end live in order to test out functionality.

## Built with

- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - Used to interconnect and communicate different parts of the web-app.
